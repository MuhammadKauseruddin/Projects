Introsort begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the (logarithm of) the number of elements being sorted.
When the number of elements is below some threshold,introsort can switch to a non-recursive sorting algoithm such as insertion sort that performs fewer swaps,comparisions or other operations on such small arrays.
