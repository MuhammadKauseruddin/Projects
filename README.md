Introsort or introspective sort is a hybrid sorting algoithm which use more than one sorting algoithm to solve the same problem efficiently.
Introsort begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the (logarithm of) the number of elements being sorted.
Max depth is calculated by log(n)*2.
The algorithm is implemented in C# so you can easily run this code in Microsoft visual studio(IDE) using C# program.
